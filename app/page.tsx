My Prediction:
The enhanced page is probably calling:

/api/situations/leaderboard (with different parameters)

But your working interface calls:

/api/situations (with the parameters that work)

Expand that debug panel and show me what's inside! That will tell us exactly how to fix the API call to get your teams and data showing properly! 🕵️
Once we see the error details, I can fix the parameter mapping in about 2 minutes and you'll have teams displaying perfectly! 🚀RetryDNFL Situational Analysis

🚨 The Problem:
The enhanced page is calling /api/situations/leaderboard but your working API is at /api/situations!
Enhanced page calls: /api/situations/leaderboard ❌
Working API is at: /api/situations ✅
🔧 Quick Fix - Update the API Call:
The enhanced page is trying to call the wrong endpoint. Let me fix this:Enhanced NFL Situational Analysis Page with DebugInteractive artifact ∙ Version 2 Enhanced NFL Situational Analysis Page with DebugInteractive artifact ∙ Version 3 Enhanced NFL Situational Analysis Page with DebugInteractive artifact ∙ Version 4 🎯 What I Fixed:

API endpoint: Changed from /api/situations/leaderboard → /api/situations
Response structure: Changed from result.data → result.rows (to match your API format)
Parameter mapping: Fixed to match your working API parameters

🚀 Deploy This Fix:

Copy the updated code from the artifact above
Replace your app/nfl/situational/page.tsx file
Deploy to Vercel
Refresh the /nfl/situational page

💡 Expected Result:
After this fix, you should see:

✅ No more HTTP 500 error
✅ Teams displayed: CIN, LA, SF, GB, HOU, etc.
✅ Real stats: 192, 164, 151 yards
✅ Multiple games where available (like J.Addison with 2 games)

This connects your enhanced interface to your working API endpoint! 🔥
Deploy the fix and let's see those teams finally display properly!RetryDHow do i setup my site to go directly to the NFL Situational Analysis page that you created? We don't even need this dark oneEditPerfect! Let's make the enhanced NFL Situational Analysis page your homepage! 🎯
🔧 Step-by-Step Instructions:
Step 1: Replace Your Homepage

Find your current homepage file: app/page.tsx
Open that file
Delete everything in that file
Copy the entire enhanced React component from the artifact above
Paste it into app/page.tsx
Save the file

Step 2: Deploy

Commit and push to GitHub
Wait for Vercel to deploy
Visit bankrollkings.com - it will now go directly to the situational analysis!

🎯 Alternative Approach (If You Want to Keep Structure):
If you want to keep some navigation structure, you can:

Update app/page.tsx to redirect:

typescript'use client';
import { useEffect } from 'react';
import { useRouter } from 'next/navigation';

export default function HomePage() {
  const router = useRouter();
  
  useEffect(() => {
    router.push('/nfl/situational');
  }, [router]);

  return (
    <div className="flex items-center justify-center min-h-screen">
      <div className="animate-spin rounded-full h-8 w-8 border-b-2 border-blue-600"></div>
      <p className="ml-3">Redirecting to NFL Analysis...</p>
    </div>
  );
}
🚀 Recommended: Direct Replacement
I recommend the first approach - just replace your homepage entirely with the enhanced situational analysis page. That way:

✅ bankrollkings.com → Goes directly to your moneymaker tool
✅ No unnecessary navigation
✅ Users immediately see the betting analysis

Which approach do you prefer? Replace the homepage entirely, or redirect to /nfl/situational?
Either way, you'll get rid of the dark interface and go straight to the enhanced tool with teams and real data! 💪RetryDOk great now we have action. Can we spice up the interface please> It looks really bland.EditAMAZING! 🎉 It's working perfectly! I can see:

✅ Teams displaying: DAL, CLE, DET, MIA
✅ Real stats: 483, 477, 473 yards
✅ Defense tiers: bottom10 (color-coded in green)
✅ 25 players found

Now let's make this interface absolutely stunning for your betting platform! 🚀
